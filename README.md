This work is about a partition problem which is an instance of the distance magic graph labeling
 problem. Given positive integers n,k and a partition for n with size k that is p1,p2...pk and given s(n,k)=sum(1,n)/k 
 can we put the numbers from 1 to n into k sets with the sizes p1,p2...pk and the sum in every set is s(n,k)?
 the problem is also related to NP-Complete problems
